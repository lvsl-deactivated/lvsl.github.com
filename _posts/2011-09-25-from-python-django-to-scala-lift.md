It's been 4th year of my heavy usage of python and djagno.
I started using python since 2.4 and django since 0.96.
Both python and django are great tools, and worth spending time mastering them.

But, the dynamic nature of python has it's own price.
If your applications is heaviliy distributed and multithreaded,
well... The correctness and performance of your app will be hardly acceptable.

This is why using language with static typing and well done threading model might help a lot.

So i decided to put an experiment:
Switch one of my app to scala+lift, and share my experience with you.

In the first place, as i don't know scala, I'm going to learn it first.

These are some free books on scala for newbies i found:
* [Scala School, a book from Twitter developers](http://twitter.github.com/scala_school/)
* [Programming Scala, a book from ObjectMentor and again Twitter developers](http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596155957/)

And some books on lift framework:
* [Simply Lift](http://simply.liftweb.net/)
* [Exploring List, book providing in-depth coverage of the Lift Web Framework](http://exploring.liftweb.net/)

So these are my goals for the first few weeks!

*P.S.*
*As a python developer i constantly type list instead of list^W lift*
